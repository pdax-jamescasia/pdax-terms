<h2><strong>19. NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR INVESTMENT ADVICE</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PDAX is not your investment advisor and has no fiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any Trades or any other transactions, decisions, or activities carried out by you using the PDAX Platform and/or Services. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or is intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause, either you or PDAX to be treated as partners or joint venturers, or as the agent of the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You understand and agree that the information on the PDAX Platform, or in any of PDAX’s social media pages, social media groups, and websites, is solely intended to inform users of the nature of PDAX’s business, products, and the Services. It is not intended, and does not constitute any form of investment or financial advice, or legal or tax advice, or an offer to purchase or invest in any kind or type of Digital Asset. No information on the PDAX Platform, or in any of PDAX’s social media pages, social media groups, and websites should be taken as an endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of any company offering to sell or purchase Digital Assets. No communication or information provided to you by PDAX shall be considered or treated as advice. You understand that any recommendations or commentary made by PDAX or its employees or representatives or other Users should be considered generalized in nature and that you must use your own independent judgment and/or seek the advice of an expert before taking any action as a result of any such recommendation or commentary. PDAX does not make any warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any such recommendation or commentary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You also understand and agree that there are inherent risks in relying, using, or retrieving any information from the PDAX Platform, and in any of PDAX’s social media pages, social media groups, and websites. PDAX encourages you to evaluate any information you may encounter from these sources and to seek help or guidance from appropriate professionals to evaluate any product, service or opinion.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that PDAX is designed to integrate services by its clients’ other Digital Asset exchanges, banks, or financial institutions, not to replace their services.

</li>
<li>
<p>You acknowledge that any requests for information are unsolicited and any information provided shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice by PDAX to you, nor constitute the formation of an investment advisory relationship, or any other client-advisor relationship.

<h2><strong>20. DIGITAL ASSETS</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PDAX supports specific Digital Assets. The Company reserves the right to elect which Digital Assets will be available, and it may change the same from time to time. The Company shall not be held liable for any damage or loss you may incur by transacting or attempting to transact a Digital Asset which PDAX does not or ceases to support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since blockchain transactions are immutable, once an on-chain Transaction for a Digital Asset is confirmed or processed by its blockchain&#x27;s validator nodes, PDAX is not able to reverse or cancel such Digital Asset Transactions, but the Company reserves the right to reverse or cancel any off-chain Transaction as provided in this Agreement or in the Trading Rules, including potential high-risk transactions such as those made using reversible payment methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX’s support of any particular Digital Asset for transfer, storage, trading, or any other activity is not in any way indicative of PDAX’s approval, endorsement, or recommendation of the Digital Asset or the integrity, security, or reliability of the Digital Asset or the software, networks, protocols, systems, and other technology used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in the Digital Asset. PDAX expressly disavows any warranty about the soundness or suitability of any Digital Asset for trading or ownership by you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From time to time and in PDAX’s sole and absolute discretion, PDAX may remove one or more Digital Assets from the Platform such that you will no longer be able to access such Digital Assets as part of the Services and will be no longer able to maintain balances in such Digital Assets or make any deposits or withdrawal thereof, in each case with immediate effect for any reason or no reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, where PDAX is required to do so by any applicable law or regulation including, without limitation, any securities laws, or any court or authority to which PDAX is subject in any jurisdiction. You hereby acknowledge and consent to PDAX’s right to remove a Digital Asset from trading on the PDAX Platform, including, without limitation, to cancel your outstanding instructions or Orders for the removed Digital Assets and require you to withdraw such removed Digital Assets, if withdrawal is still possible, within a reasonable period of time, beyond which you will no longer be able to access such Digital Assets. Under no circumstances shall the PDAX Group be responsible or liable for any direct or indirect losses (including loss of profits, business, or opportunities), damages or costs suffered by you or any other person or entity, due to any of the PDAX Group’s action or inaction in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are fully responsible for any mistakes, errors or defects which may arise in the course of any Transaction that leads to partial or complete loss of your Digital Assets. PDAX shall not be liable for any damages resulting from any actions previously described. PDAX shall in no case be liable for any loss, including, but not limited to, transfers between addresses, transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting from your improper actions or activities, or erroneous transactions, deposits or withdrawals resulting in your Digital Assets being lost. PDAX shall not compensate you for any losses resulting from such actions or activities.</p>

<p>As part of its legal and regulatory obligations, PDAX maintains policies and procedures to protect against money-laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes, and to satisfy other obligations to which PDAX may be subject under its KYC obligations and other related laws and regulations. For these purposes, PDAX shall require you as a PDAX Account holder and User to provide certain personal information in accordance with its KYC Program and Procedures found mainly in the mobile app and at <a href="https://support.pdax.ph/hc/en-us/articles/6132563734169-How-do-I-verify-my-account-">https://support.pdax.ph/hc/en-us/articles/6132563734169-How-do-I-verify-my-account-</a>. Among other purposes, the personal information gathered will be used to determine the customer&#x27;s overall risk profile based on predetermined rules and tolerances. Lower risk rated customers require less due diligence and transaction monitoring, while higher risk rated customers require increased due diligence and transaction monitoring.</p>

<p>You must promptly notify PDAX if you are or become a PEP, you are a relative or close associate of someone that is or becomes a PEP, or you are otherwise connected to a party that is or becomes a PEP. You recognize and agree that this notification is material to your risk profile rating.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You may elect to use the PDAX Platform to store or keep your Digital Assets temporarily until such time you transfer it to your own designated Digital Asset wallet. You can receive, hold, and transfer Digital Assets to, in, and from your PDAX Account to a custodial or non-custodial wallet that you designate, and which you hereby certify to be your own, or to be under your name.PDAX bears no responsibility or liability for: (1) the management and security of any wallet that you designate; and (2) the failure of any transfer of Digital Assets between your PDAX Account and your designated wallet.

</li>
<li>
<p>The Digital Assets that are reflected in your PDAX Account balance at any time will be located at Digital Asset addresses owned by PDAX. Title to Digital Assets that you legally own shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to PDAX. As the owner of such Digital Assets, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. PDAX shall have no liability for Digital Asset fluctuations or loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX may hold your Digital Assets together with PDAX’s own Digital Assets and those of other PDAX Users. Although PDAX maintains separate ledgers for User accounts and accounts held by PDAX for its own benefit, PDAX shall have no obligation to segregate by blockchain address Digital Assets owned by you from Digital Assets owned by other customers or by PDAX. PDAX may elect to segregate them by blockchain address, at its own discretion. You recognize and agree that PDAX may change internal configurations of blockchain addresses and wallet segregations, as may be necessitated by the improvement, maintenance, or development of the PDAX Platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX stores and manages the Digital Asset private keys associated with Digital Asset addresses, which are necessary for Digital Asset transactions to be approved. You will not have access to such private keys. PDAX may store such private keys and related information in a combination of online and offline storage. You acknowledge that the retrieval of information from offline storage may delay the initiation or execution of Transactions through the Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX shall have policies in place to ensure security and protection on the PDAX Platform. However, you understand and agree that using the PDAX Platform to store your Digital Assets and Fiat Currencies entails inherent and residual risks that may result in potential loss of stored assets. PDAX shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from these risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, you acknowledge that PDAX has not encouraged you, for security reasons, to keep Digital Assets in the PDAX Platform except in order to fund or fulfill Transaction obligations. You acknowledge that you are leaving and storing your assets within the PDAX Platform at your own risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX reserves the right to charge storage fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to availability of the Services and the limitations and conditions described in these Terms and Conditions, the Trading Rules, the inherent features of the PDAX Platform, and the inherent features of specific Digital Assets and their respective blockchains:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may initiate a deposit to your PDAX Account of any Digital Asset supported by the PDAX Platform.

Upon successful completion and confirmation of such transfer during business hours, the Digital Assets will be credited to your PDAX Account.</li>
<li>You may request a transfer of Digital Assets from your PDAX Account to an external address by submitting the prescribed withdrawal request. Subject to any other limits set by PDAX in its sound discretion, the maximum amount of a particular Digital Asset that you may transfer from your PDAX Account to an external address at any given time is the amount by which the balance of such Digital Asset in your Account exceeds your minimum required balance, as described in paragraph 25(c)(iv).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that: (i) each transfer you initiate using the Services complies with all requirements imposed by PDAX, relevant third parties, and the applicable rules of the Digital Asset; (ii) the Digital Asset address to which any Digital Assets are to be transferred is properly formatted and suitable for the type of Digital Asset being transferred; and (3) there are no errors in any of the transfer instructions you provide using the Services. The Digital Assets you attempt to transfer may be permanently lost upon your failure to comply with any of the preceding requirements and you expressly assume such risk for which you shall hold the PDAX Group free and harmless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may permanently lose any Digital Assets that you attempt to transfer to your PDAX Account if it is not a PDAX-supported Digital Asset. PDAX will not be liable if you lose Digital Assets due to any such attempted transfer or due to your transfer of Digital Assets to a Digital Asset Address other than that which PDAX has specified. You hereby release PDAX from any obligation to attempt to retrieve Digital Assets sent to an incorrect Digital Asset address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX is not able to reverse any transfers and will not have any responsibility or liability if you have provided a Digital Asset address for the transfer that is incorrect, improperly formatted, erroneous, or intended for a different type of Digital Asset. You understand and agree that PDAX shall not be liable for loss or damage caused by transferring your Digital Asset to a wrong wallet address, cross-chain transfers, or any erroneously transferred Digital Asset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX makes no warranty, representation, or guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to complete any transfer of Digital Assets. The processing and completion time for each transfer may depend on third party actions that are beyond the control of PDAX, retrieval of relevant information from offline storage, confirmation of the transaction on the underlying blockchain or network, and other factors. You understand and agree that high volume or large withdrawals may not always be immediately available. Such transactions are subject to availability of funds of third-party service providers, banks, and the asset storage policy of PDAX, and as such, PDAX or any third-party service provider may require you to wait or set an appointment in order to withdraw your Digital Assets.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot create any pledge, mortgage, security, or encumbrance over any Digital Asset in your PDAX Account without PDAX’s express prior approval in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the PDAX Group from and against any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost, or expense, including attorneys’ fees, fines or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority arising from your designation or use of and the transfer of Digital Assets to and from your PDAX Account to your wallet or an external Digital Asset address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiat Currency</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You understand and agree that PDAX has third-party service providers or different payment channels such as, but not limited to, banks, remittance centers, or other facilities capable of disbursing Fiat Currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX does not own any of these third-party service providers and only has a client-service provider relationship. As such, the Company has no control over the requirements that these service providers may set to process encashments or receipt of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You authorize PDAX to use these channels in order to fulfill your requests to withdraw or return your Fiat Currency/money. PDAX shall not be held liable for any damage or loss arising from your transaction with these payment channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You understand and agree that high volume or large withdrawals may not always be immediately available. Such transactions are subject to availability of funds of the third-party service providers, banks, and the asset storage policy of the PDAX, and as such, PDAX or any third-party service provider may require you to wait or set an appointment in order to withdraw your Fiat Currencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You understand and agree that PDAX shall not be liable for loss or damage caused by transferring your Fiat Currency to a wrong third party account or any erroneously transferred Fiat Currency. PDAX is not able to reverse any transfers and will not have any responsibility or liability if you have provided account details for the transfer that is incorrect, improperly formatted, or erroneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You shall be subject to the total cash-in and cash-out transaction limits (daily, monthly, and annual limit) applicable to your particular account tier. Users can have all or part of the withdrawable amount in their PDAX Account returned to them , which is the amount in excess of the minimum required balance and unrealized losses. However, Users cannot request withdrawal if the withdrawable amount is less than the withdrawal fee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cashing-In and Cashing-Out of Funds</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can cash-in your Fiat Currency by transferring them to PDAX through Third Party Accounts. Before you transfer Fiat Currency to or from your PDAX Account, you will be required to designate via the Services one or more Third Party Accounts, through the Services. Such Third Party Accounts must generally be in your name and not the name of a third party. PDAX may limit the number of Third Party Accounts that you may designate to be associated with your PDAX Account. You may be required to verify that you control the Third Party Account that you use to cash-in to your PDAX Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX bears no responsibility or liability for: (1) the management and security of any Third Party Accounts; (2) the failure of any transfer of Fiat Currency between your PDAX Account and Third Party Accounts, if such transaction is not supported either by PDAX or the Third Party Accounts.

<li>
<p>Subject to the limitations and conditions described in this Agreement, you may: (1) initiate a transfer of Fiat Currency from a verified Third Party Account to your PDAX Account at any time; and (2) initiate a transfer of Fiat Currency from your PDAX Account to a verified Third Party Account at any time. You hereby authorize the PDAX: (1) to transfer the amount of Fiat Currency specified by you from your PDAX Account to the Third Party Account you specify upon your submission of such transfer request via the Services; and (2) to deduct any fees applicable to such transfer that are charged by PDAX or its third‐party service providers from such transferred amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are required to maintain in your Account a sufficient minimum required balance of the applicable Digital Assets and/or Fiat Currency to satisfy any open Orders, maintenance margin (as described in the Trading Rules or the Manual Broker-Dealer Rules if applicable to you), and applicable fees, and such other obligations or liabilities to PDAX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to any other limits set by PDAX in its discretion, the maximum amount of a particular type of Fiat Currency that you may transfer from your PDAX Account is the amount by which the balance of such Fiat Currency in your PDAX Account exceeds your minimum required balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The processing time required for the transfer of Fiat Currency to or from your PDAX Account may depend on third parties responsible for maintaining the applicable Third Party Accounts and other factors. PDAX does not guarantee or warrant the period of time for the transfer to and availability of the Fiat Currency in your PDAX Account or your Third Party Account, as applicable.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Relationship</p>
<p>You understand and agree that the use and concept of “deposit” in this Agreement and as applied to your act of placing Digital Assets and/or Fiat Currency on the PDAX Platform for credit to your PDAX Account and for purpose of funding your Orders is in the generic sense and does not give rise to a legal deposit under the Civil Code of the Philippines, banking laws, or any other statute, regulation, or jurisprudence, nor does it give rise to a trust relationship, both expressly or impliedly. You expressly agree that PDAX does not hold Digital Assets and/or Fiat Currency in the PDAX Platform in trust for you, and that PDAX does not have the legal obligations of a trustee, or any other fiduciary relationship.</p>
<p>There is no relationship of principal to agent, employer to employee, partnership or joint venture between PDAX and the User, and their stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and other persons under their supervision, control or employ, including their assignees.</p>
<p>There is a binding legal relationship only between PDAX and the User. PDAX shall have no relationship with the User’s clients, if any, whether in law or equity.</p>
<p>PDAX shall not have the obligations of a trustee, whether expressly or impliedly, with the User’s clients, if any.</p>

<p>If PDAX permits you to avail of mass payout Services, you shall be bound by the Mass Payout Rules.

<h2><strong>26. PDAX PLATFORM AVAILABILITY AND ACCURACY</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access to the Services and/or the PDAX Platform may become limited, delayed, or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume.

</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX cannot and does not guarantee or warrant that the PDAX Platform and the Services will be continuously available or be free from interruption and that all Orders will be accepted, recorded, remain open, filled, or executed, or that your PDAX Account will be accessible at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our customer support response times may be significantly delayed from time to time. Under no circumstances shall PDAX be liable for any alleged damages arising from service interruptions, delays in processing transactions, or delays in or lack of timely response from customer support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDAX does not warrant or guarantee that the PDAX Platform, and its contents and information will always be entirely accurate, complete or current, and/or entirely free of technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. PDAX reserves the right, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to change or update the information on the PDAX Platform from time to time without notice, including without limitation information regarding our policies, procedures, and the Services.
